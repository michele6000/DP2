Setting the work environment for the project
--------------------------------------------
Create a new single eclipse java project for this package (by creating project from
existing sources or by importing project).
The new project should be already configured. If it is not, it may be necessary to
add the jars under lib to the build path and to attach the sources
available in lib-src to the corresponding jar library.
DO NOT USE tomcat-build.xml directly. Instead use the buildTest0.xml (which imports it).

Start tomcat by running the start-tomcat target
(from buildTest1.xml).
The other instructions for using buildTest1.xml are included in the assignment text.
